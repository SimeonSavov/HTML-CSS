## Introduction to HTML and CSS (Lesson 1)

In this lesson, I delved into the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, laying the groundwork for my web development journey.

**Task 1: Initial HTML Structure**

I crafted a basic HTML document, including a head section and a body section. By declaring `<!DOCTYPE html>`, I ensured HTML5 compliance. I added a title and incorporated a paragraph with emphasized text using the `<strong>` tag.

**Task 2: Fruits Page with Images**

I developed a page showcasing different fruits, employing HTML `<img>` tags within paragraphs. I organized the content into sections, each featuring images of various fruits. This task highlighted the importance of proper HTML structure for images and paragraphs.

**Task 3: The Brown Bear Information**

I expanded the HTML document with information about the brown bear species. Utilizing tags such as `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<ol>`, `<p>`, and `<img>`, I structured the content and included a link to learn more about brown bears.

**Task 4: To-Do List Page Styling**

I applied CSS styling to the To-Do List page using an external stylesheet. By adjusting margins, padding, width, and font size, I aimed for a visually appealing presentation. I also centered list items and headings for improved readability.

**Task 5: Nested Lists Implementation**

I enhanced the HTML structure by adding nested lists with different list item types. This task demonstrated the flexibility of HTML lists for organizing content.

**Task 6: Definition Lists Integration**

I incorporated definition lists into the HTML structure, featuring terms and descriptions. Utilizing `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` tags, I aimed for a clear presentation.

**Task 7: Reversed List Page**

I implemented a reversed list in HTML using the "reversed" attribute, displaying step-by-step directions within an ordered list.

**Task 8: Book Story Page Creation**

I crafted a fictional book story using HTML tags such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<strong>`, `*em*`, and `<q>`. I structured the narrative with headings, paragraphs, and emphasized text.

**Task 9: Styling for Book Story**

I applied custom styling to the Book Story page using an external CSS file. My adjustments focused on the appearance of the card containing the story, headings, and paragraphs.

**Task 10: World Cup News Content and Styling**

I enriched the World Cup News page with information about a historic FIFA World Cup qualifiers match and notable destinations. Incorporating custom styling enhanced the visual presentation of the content.

As I progress in my learning journey, these foundational skills gained from completing these tasks will serve as a solid base for tackling more advanced web development concepts.
